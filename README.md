# PythonChallenge
Uses python scripts to analyze two datasets:

1) PyBank:  Develop a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company.  The financial data is found in the Resource subfolder (budget_data.csv).  This dataset is composed of two columns:  'Date' and 'Profit/Losses'.  Created a Python script that analyzed the records to calcualte each of the following:

a) The total number of months included in the dataset

b) The net total amount of 'Profit/Losses' over the entire period

c) The average of the changes in 'Profit/Losses" over the entire period

d) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

e) The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script prints the analysis in a summary table to the terminal, as well as exports a text file.

  

2) PyPoll:  Develop a Python script for a small rural town in modernizing the vote counting process.  A set of poll data is found in the Resource subfolder (election_data.csv).  This dataset is composed of three columns:  'Voter ID', 'County', and 'Candidate'.  Created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  1) The total number of votes cast

  2) A complete list of candidates who received votes

  3) The percentage of votes each candidate won

  4) The total number of votes each candidate won

  5) The winner of the election based on popular vote.
  
  The final script prints the analysis in a summary table to the terminal, as well as exports a text file.
